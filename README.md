# ImageSeg_U-net

**ImageSeg_U-net** is an image segmentation project that implements the U-Net architecture to perform semantic segmentation on images. The model is designed to accurately identify and label each pixel in an input image, enabling detailed scene understanding for applications like medical imaging, self-driving vehicles, and more.

## Features

- **U-Net Architecture**: A convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed for semantic segmentation, with encoder-decoder pathways and skip connections for precise localization.
- **Custom Dataset Support**: Easily adaptable to custom datasets with minimal modifications.
- **Efficient Training Loop**: Modular training pipeline with logging and checkpointing.
- **Visualization**: Visualize predicted segmentations alongside ground truth masks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Recommended: Create a virtual environment

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Himanshu12328/ImageSeg_U-net.git
cd ImageSeg_U-net
```

### Training

Run the training script:

```bash
python model.py --data_dir path/to/dataset --epochs 50 --batch_size 8
```

Adjust the hyperparameters as needed:
- `--data_dir`: Path to your dataset
- `--epochs`: Number of training epochs
- `--batch_size`: Batch size for training
